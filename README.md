Code base for assignment 5 in PPL course.

This assignment was about generators in scheme which are the course called _lazy lists_, CPS (continuation passing style) and an introduction to Prolog.
In this assignment, we implemented a few generator functions in Scheme, a few CPS functions in Scheme
and wrote very basic Prolog procedures.

All of the assignments descriptions in this course can be found [here](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~ppl202/Assignments).

Code base for assignment 5 in PPL course.

This assignment was about _lazy lists_, CPS (continuation passing style) and an introduction to logic programming using Prolog.
_Lazy lists_ is the name the course used for generators in Scheme.

In this assignment, we implemented a few generator functions in Scheme, a few CPS functions in Scheme
and wrote very basic Prolog procedures.
